# Stock Charts 

An Reactjs web app that uses the Alphavantage Time Series Stock APIs to display Daily and Candlestick charts as well as provide an overview of the specified equity. 

NOTE: Due to the limited number of API calls (5 / min) that can be made, requests are stored in the local storage for 60 mins.
